# 🌦️ Extreme Weather Classification – Machine Learning Project  
### Machine Learning & Parallel Computing (MLPC)

This project explores how machine learning can be used to detect **Extreme Weather** from global meteorological data.  

Using Python in Google Colab, I built a full ML pipeline that cleans the data, engineers useful features, and compares two classification models.

## 📌 Project Summary
- **Goal:** Classify weather as **Normal (0)** or **Extreme (1)**  
- **Dataset:** GlobalWeatherRepository.csv  
- **Approach:** End-to-end ML workflow  
- **Best model:** Random Forest (≈95% accuracy, AUC = 0.99)

This project helped me understand how ML can support climate analysis, early warnings, and environmental decision-making.

## 🔧 Techniques Used
### **Data Preparation**
- Handling missing values & anomalies  
- Creating a clean binary label  
- Feature scaling & encoding  
- Oversampling to fix class imbalance  

### **Models**
- 🌳 **Decision Tree Classifier**  
- 🌲 **Random Forest Classifier** (best-performing)

### **Evaluation**
- Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score  
- Confusion Matrix  
- ROC Curve & AUC

## 🧠 What I Learned
- How to prepare real-world datasets for ML  
- The impact of imbalance and noise on model quality  
- Comparing model behavior and performance  
- Interpreting metrics beyond accuracy  
- Building clear, explainable ML pipelines  
- Python skills with Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
